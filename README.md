#  Adaptive Hypergraph Learning with Multi-Stage Optimizations for Image and Tag Recommendation

 **DATASET FOR IMAGE RECOMMENDATION CRAWLED FROM FLICKR**  
 

 
     
  The dataset consists of 99,777 geo-tagged photos. It contains both indoor and outdoor medium sized photos of popular Greek landmarks, various city scenes, and landscapes.

   The following files are included:

1) images.mat: contains the id of 99,777 images in string form.
2) geo.mat: the 1st column contains image id (as number), the 2nd column contains image latitude and the 3rd column contains image longitude.
3) text.mat contains the text associated to each image.

    Raw images could be provided upon request
